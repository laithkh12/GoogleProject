- **Completion Function**: Returns the five best sentence completions based on user input.
- **AI Assistance**: Allows the use of AI tools (e.g., Gemini AI+LLM) to accelerate development.
- **Flexible Language Support**: The initialization function can be written in any language, while the completion function is in Python.
- **Detailed Output**: The function provides details about each completion, including the source file, sentence position, and a score.
